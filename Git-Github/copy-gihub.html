<!--to push to new git repo-->
git push -u origin main -->'u' means push to central branch always(upstream) -->"Upstream" would refer to the main repo that other people will be pulling from,
e.g. your GitHub repo. The -u option automatically sets that upstream for you, linking your repo to a central one. That way, in the future,
Git "knows" where you want to push to and where you want to pull from,
so you can use git pull or git push without arguments. A little bit down, this article explains and demonstrates this concept.
When you push a new branch the first time use: >git push -u origin
After that, you can just type a shorter command: >git push
The first-time -u option created a persistent upstream tracking branch with your local branch.
